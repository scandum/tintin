* STUFF I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

- Keep last input visible with repeat enter enabled.

- would be nice to have "#map list" show the variable being filtered on, instead of defaulting to roomname ie, I'm currently writing a script to save "#map list {roomnote} {{\w+}}" into a variable, then map get roomnote for each item in the list and display it...would be nice if when listing for a roomnote, it showed the roomnote

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* NEW STUFF

- path improvements
- remote session
- map sharing
- cursor extension for vim
- interactive script tutorial

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ISSUES

- TinTin++ only allows 1 action triggering per line.

- TinTin++ probably should substitute escapes in if checks.

- TinTin++ is not handling #return inside #regex intuitively.
