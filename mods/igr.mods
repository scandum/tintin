May 2020        2.02.04
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

help.c          Updated the MSLP helpfile.

scan.c          Added #scan forward, does the same as #textin.

substitute.c    Added a warning when using &variable on an undefined variable
                in math operations.

draw.c          Updated the #draw line mode to behave more distinct from the
                #draw side mode. When teed a horizontal line can have only
                the left or right side teed when specified. Similarly a
                vertical line can have the top or bot side teed.

banner.c        Added the tt++ -g startup option to startup tintin with a gui.
                So far it only supports a connection manager.

main.c          Added the SYSTEM CRASH event, %0 holds the error message.

screen.c        #screen inputregion now takes a 5th argument to assign a
                name, can be used with the RECEIVED INPUT [NAME] event.

screen.c        Added #screen swap, swaps the input and scroll region height.

mapper.c        The MAP ENTER ROOM and MAP EXIT ROOM events will store the
                direction traveled in the %2 argument.

draw.c          #draw CALIGN will prune and center text.

                #draw LALIGN will prune and left align text.

                #draw RALIGN will prune and right align text.

                #draw TALIGN will show the top of the text if it is too long
                to fit the square, cutting off the bottom. The default is to
                bottom align and cut off the top.

                #draw UALIGN will unwrap and rewrap text.

math.c          Added very basic ? : ternary operator support in #math. It
                currently only supports simple assignments like:
                #math result $variable < 5 ? 0 : $variable

screen.c        Added several #screen get INPUT_ options.

daemon.c        Added DAEMON ATTACHED and DAEMON DETACHED events.

mapper.c        Added #map flag quiet, gets rid of build walk spam.

event.c         With mouse pixel mode enabled the %7 argument of a mouse
                event will contain nw, n, ne, w, c, e, sw, s, se, depending
                on where on a character you clicked.

                You can, for example use #if {"%7" == "{nw|w|sw}"} to check
                if the left side of a character was clicked.

help.c          Added #help edit and #help editing

config.c        Added the #config mouse pixels option for pixel precision.
                Requires the latext xterm or mintty release to work.

tokenize.z      The default ! repeat character can now be used in scripts.
                Use with caution. To repeat the last command when you press
                ctrl-enter use: #macro {\e[13;5u} {!}

tintin.h        Increased BUFFER_SIZE from 30KB to 40KB. 

screen.c        Added #screen scrollbar on/off, currently only works with
                mintty / wintin++. Allows using the scrollbar with tintin's
                own scrollback buffer. Works automatically once enabled.

list.c          Changed #list simplify to work in a similar manner as
                #list sort and #list order. 

draw.c          #draw now takes a second color argument. First color argument
                sets the box color, the second sets the text color.

split.c         Updated #split to take a 5th argument to set the height of
                the input region, #split without an argument defaults to
                #split 0 1 0 0 1.

event.c         Added event group lookups, can use #event mouse to see all
                mouse events.

edit.c          Added the [CATCH] EDIT FINISHED and EDIT STARTED events.

cursor.c        Added #cursor {page} which has several sub-options that can
                be used in edit mode.

                ctrl-home is bound by default to #cursor page home
                ctrl-end  is bound by default to #cursor page end

cursor.c        Added #cursor {soft enter} which allows inserting new lines
                while in edit mode, it's bound to shift-enter by default. A
                regular enter will exit edit mode.

edit.c          Added the #edit command, used to enter edit mode and perform
                various edit buffer operations.

cursor.c        Added #cursor up and #cursor down, moves cursor up/down in
                multiline input regions.

event.c         Added the INPUT MOUSE event, which triggers when using the
                mouse in the input region.

cursor.c        Added multiline input support. Use #screen inputregion to
                enable. For example:

                #screen inputregion -3 1 -1 -1
                #split 0 3

cursor.c        #cursor preserve macro and reset macro have been moved to
                #cursor macro {preserve|reset}

                #cursor echo and #cursor insert have been moved to
                #cursor flag {echo|insert} {on|off}

input.c         Added infinite input support, TinTin++ will still crash
                somewhere down the line until the rest of the engine has
                infinite string support as well. When CHILD LOCKED the
                input buffer is capped.

class.c         Added #event CLASS LOAD <NAME>, triggers after a class is
                loaded.
                Added #event CLASS CLEAR <NAME>, triggers before a class is
                cleared.

scan.c          Added the #scan dir <dir> <variable> option, will scan the
                given file or directory and store the info in the provided
                variable.

scan.c          Modernized #scan, includes a warning when the old syntax is
                used.

variable.c      #return now returns a local result, this should solve issues
                with function nesting.

list.c          Added #list {<list>} index {nest} which can be used to index
                a two dimensional table as a one dimensional list. After a
                table has been indexed, #list find, order, sort, and reverse
                will work.

triggers.c      Added the <900> color tag which can be used in substitutions
                to restore the text color to the original text color.

                #sub {\bsmurf\b} {<bdf>smurf<900>}
                #showme {<afa>A smurf is smurfing here.}

draw.c          Added the SCALED drawing option. When used the size of the
                square is increased depending on the size of the inputted
                text.

documentation   Added docs/link.txt file with the initial documentation for
                link handling.

buffer.c        #buffer find now places the found keyword at the top instead
                of at the bottom of the page.

path.c          Added #path save {BOTH} <variable> to save both the forward
                and backward path, as well as any given delays. Keep in mind
                that delays will only work properly for forward going paths.

path.c          Added a third field to #path insert to specify the delay.

mapper.c        Added a delay field to #map exits, which will be used
                when using #path run with a delay argument.

data.c          Added #info sessions save which will save the data on all
                sessions to $info[SESSIONS].

data.c          #info session save now saves the data to $info[SESSION][NAME]
                rather than to $info[SESSION][SESSION_NAME]

cursor.c        Added #cursor position <column> to move the cursor to the
                given column.

show.c          Added RECEIVED ERROR event. Example:
                #event {RECEIVED ERROR} {#info stack}

class.c         Added #class {name} assign {argument} which will execute the
                argument, assigning all newly created triggers to the given
                class.

draw.c          Added #draw buffer, which draws the scrollback buffer based
                on the scrolling state.

draw.c          Added #draw foreground flag, which allows inactive sessions
                to draw.

update.c        Added END OF RUN event which triggers at the end of #map or
                #path run.

mapper.c        Added MAP CREATE EXIT and MAP DELETE EXIT events.

history.c       Added #history get <variable> <start> <end> option.

draw.c          Added #draw map <square> option.

event.c         Added MAP ROOM and MAP REGION mouse events. MAP ROOM only
                triggers when the mouse is above a room, MAP REGION triggers
                anywhere in the map region, as defined by default or as
                defined with #map offset.

files.c         #read will now warn if there is a possibly missing semicolon.

config.c        Can add non-colors in #config command_color by escaping the
                characters. Example: #con command <178>\>\ <128>

line.c          Added #line multishot {number} {argument} which should make
                all created triggers fire the given number of times before
                expiring.

line.c          Added #line local {argument} which should make all indirectly
                created variables local.

variable.c      Updated %h to allow #echo %+40h {some text}

update.c        Added the DISPLAY UPDATE event which is triggered right
                before the final display update when new data has become
                available.

port.c          Added PORT INITIALIZED and PORT UNINITIALIZED events, both
                can be prefixed with GAG to suppress the default system
                message.

path.c          Updated #path unzip to take the new speedwalk format.

telopt_client.c Added IAC SB NAWS event, can be caught.

split.c         Added SCREEN SPLIT FILL event, which triggers on the
                split line drawing routine, can be caught.

memory.c        Added a custom memory stack, still a work in progress.

utf8.c          Added #config charset CP1251TOUTF8

cursor.c        Added #cursor {preserve macro} which when called from within
                a macro will preserve the macro state. Example:

                #macro {\cg} {#showme e: end\nh: home;#cursor preserve macro}
                #macro {\cge} {#showme end}
                #macro {\cgh} {#showme home}

cursor.c        Added #cursor {reset macro} which when called from within
                a macro will reset the macro state.

path.c          Added #path get {LENGTH|POSITION} <variable>

Jan 2020        2.02.02
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

config.c        Added #config {packet patch} {auto} support which will
                result in automatic telnet eor/ga handling and automatic
                packet patching if #prompt is set correctly.

help.c          Added auto-link generation for #help when mouse tracking is
                enabled. Still experimental.

mapper.c        Added #map get/set direction/pathdir to get/set the current
                direction you are facing in numeric and alphabetic notation.

tables.c        Added italic and unitalic #highlight keywords.

tables.c        Pressing ctrl-delete will delete one word per default.

mapper.c        Fixed #map undo issues with #map insert and #map dig.

mapper.c        Now shows destination in #map exit <dir>

base.c          Added %+64b and %+64B support to #format to convert to and
                from base 64 encoding.

                Added %+64z and %+64Z support to #format to zip the string
                and convert it to base 64. May not compress it much but may
                have some utility to store passwords. Security through
                obscurity.

                Added experimental %+252b/z and %+252B/Z options for Base
                252 encoding.

draw.c          Added FAT, CURSIVE, SCROLL, and SANSSERIF draw options.

input.c         ctrl-v will now correctly capture ctrl-alt-f and similar
                combinations. ctrl-v will also allow pasting blocks of text.
                Example added to the SCRIPTS file.

event.c         Added GAG SESSION CONNECTED, GAG SESSION CREATED,
                GAG SESSION DISCONNECTED, and GAG SESSION TIMED OUT events.

mapper.c        Added #map roomflag fog. Works like #map roomflag hide but
                the flag is auto cleared on entrance.

line.c          Added #line convert options.

mapper.c        Aded MAP CREATE ROOM and MAP DELETE ROOM events.

utils.c         Increased the entropy of the random number generator.

list.c          #list order sorts existing lists numerically.

list.c          #list sort sorts existing lists alphabetically.

sort.c          Added sorting routines utilizing quadsort.

list.c          Added #list reverse option.

cursor.c        Added default bindings for ctrl-left, ctrl-right, and
                ctrl-backspace

screen.c        Added advanced link support. To create an advanced link
                surround a keyword with the \e[4m keyword \e24m tags and
                prefix it with \e]68; code \a.

                #config mouse on
                #showme {\e]68;;1;test\a\e[4mthis is a test\e[24m}
                #event {SHORT-CLICKED LINK MOUSE BUTTON ONE} {#showme {[%4]}}

screen.c        Added basic link support. To create a basic link surround a
                keyword with the \e[4m keyword \e[24m tags. When clicked with
                mouse support enabled it'll spawn a LINK mouse event.

map.c           Added #map exitflag <dir> <option> GET <variable> support.

event.c         The %4 argument of mouse clicks once again reports the word
                that has been clicked, with %5 reporting the line. Under
                construction.

screen.c        Added #screen input <square> to define the input region.
                Currently only 1 line input regions are supported. Example:
                #screen input 1 1 1 -1 will put the input line at the top of
                the screen instead of the bottom. Under construction.

Dec 2019        2.02.01
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data.c          Added CWD field to #info system to get the current working
                directory.

data.c          Added the option to use #var var[\+1] to set and retrieve a
                literal +1 instead of referencing the first index. This
                behaves like the verbatim mode and the backslash is only
                valid at the start of the line.

data.c          Added #info unicode <character> option to display
                information about the provided character.

Nov 2019        2.02.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

regex.c         Added support for using %+4s to match 4 spaces, or %+0..2d
                to match between 0 and 2 digits. Only works with letter
                arguments.

regex.c         Added %a regex as an alternative for %* because %+4* is
                not valid.

regex.c         Added %p regex which will match printable characters.

regex.c         Added %u regex which should match whole unicode characters.

utf8.c          Added BIG5toUTF8, KOI8toUTF8, ISO1toUTF8, ISO2toUTF8 charset
                config options.

utf8.c          Added GBK1TOUTF8 charset config option. When enabled 2 byte
                GBK codes are translated to unicode.

utf8.c          Added GBK-1 charset config option which should be able to
                handle GB18030.

mapper.c        Added a UNICODE GRAPHICS group to #map legend, this will
                allow you to customize most of the unicodegraphics symbols.

variable.c      Added #format <variable> %S option to do a spell check.
                Returns the number of errors found. Still a work in
                progress.

                People using %S to get the session name should switch to
                using #info session save.

data.c          Added #info session option, this data can be saved.

draw.c          Added #draw RAIN {<VARIABLE>} {[SPAWN]} {[FADE]} {[LEGEND]}

                Use tt++ -M for a default example.

class.c         Added #class clear, load, and save. See #help class.

main.c          Configurations and pathdirs are automatically assigned to
                the CONFIG and PATHDIR class on startup. Somewhat
                experimental as there may be unforseen complications.

list.c          Added #list <list> collapse and explode

mapper.c        Updated #map {} output.

nest.c          Added better #local support.

variable.c      Added #cat command. See #help cat.

event.c         Added SWIPED N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW events. These do not work
                on Termux yet, but I've asked the Termux dev to enable
                advanced mouse mode by default.

draw.c          Added #draw TABLE type which comes with the GRID option to
                change the drawing behavior. Requires a nested string
                argument. Under construction.

mapper.c        Added #map flag terrain on/off option to enable or disable
                terrain displaying. Default for new maps is on.

mapper.c        Added #map terrain <name> <symbol> [flag] and #map unterrain
                Creates a symbol, which can be colored, for the given
                terrain type. Density flags are DENSE, AMPLE, SPARSE, SCANT,
                omit for default density. Range flags are NARROW, STANDARD,
                WIDE, and VAST, omit for default.

                Decay flags are FADEIN and FADEOUT which speak for
                themselves. DOUBLE will expect the terrain symbol to be
                2 characters or a double-width unicode character.

variable.c      Added %C format option to store the given number using
                chronological notation.

                People using %C to get the screen width should switch to
                using #screen get cols <var> and #screen get rows <var>

mapper.c        Added a 4th argument to landmarks which will indicate the
                distance from which the landmark will be visible in a future
                #map describe command.

draw.c          Added HUGE option to #draw. Only supports uppercase letters,
                numbers, and a few punctuations for now.

cursor.c        Added #cursor tab <list|scrollback> <backward|forward>
                option. Allows people with custom tab settings to upgrade
                to the new format before I start messing with it.

                list goes exclusively through the tab list, scrollback goes
                exclusively through the scrollback buffer, use both list and
                scrollback to go through both.

line.c          Added #line capture <variable> <command> option.

mapper.c        Added the MAP MOUSE LOCATION event to go along with the
                SCREEN MOUSE LOCATION event. MAP MOUSE LOCATION is more
                accurate than regular MAP click events. It needs to be
                trigged with #screen raise mouse location, which is not
                supported by all terminals.

                You'll need to use ./configure --enable-dec-locator for xterm
                to enable the MOUSE LOCATION events.


list.c          Added #list <var> shuffle

mapper.c        I'm working on a new speedwalk standard that will work with
                diagonal exits. Initial support is added to the #map at,
                #map goto, and the #map jump commands. Old speedwalk support
                is going to be left unchanged.

                The format is similar to old speed walks, except that
                speedwalks like 2ene need to be changed to 2e1n1e.

                #map jump and #map at will use virtual traversal, meaning you
                can move through walls as long as the destination is an actual
                location.

                #map move and #map goto will use physical traversal, meaning
                #map goto 10w only works if there is a straight line of 10
                rooms leading west, while #map move 10w will create 10 rooms
                if static mode is disabled. Keep in mind that #map move will
                trigger map movements events while #map goto will not.

                Regular #config SPEEDWALK speedwalks are unaffected.

mapper.c        Added MAP MOUSE LOCATION event which allows more accurate
                mouse clicking reports in unicode mode on terminals which
                support it. Appears to be some obscure compile time option
                on xterm.

mapper.c        AsciiGraphics and UnicodeGraphics mapping modes now report
                the exit that was clicked on MAP MOUSE click events in the
                %2 argument.

screen.c        Added #screen raise SCREEN MOUSE LOCATION, the SCREEN MOUSE
                LOCATION in turn will report row,col,-row,-col, as well as
                the row,col,-row,-col for the pixel position of the mouse
                within the character cell. %8 will report the pixel position
                as a 3x3 cell using values 1 through 9.

mapper.c        Added the BLOCK exit flag and room flag. Works like AVOID,
                but also prevents movement into the room.

mapper.c        Added #map landmark <name> <vnum> [desc] and #map unlandmark.
                Landmarks work as fast lookup aliases and to give tintin an
                idea of locations of interest to eventually describe the map
                in words for screen readers.

mapper.c        Added #map exit <dir> color <code> option.

mapper.c        Added exit coloring for avoid/hide/invis flagged exits.

main.c          Added -V startup option to show version number.

daemon.c        Added better link lost handling to daemons.

cursor.c        Fixed #help event section on {SCREEN FOCUS}.

math.c          Added metric suffix support to #math, see #help metric.

variable.c      Added #echo %M to print numbers using the metric system,
                supported suffixes are K M, m, and u.

mapper.c        Added #map sync <filename> which will try to synchronize the
                currently loaded map with the file being read. Should be a
                valid alternative to #map read at all times.

Sep 2019        2.01.92
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mapper.c        Added #map dig <exit> {{roomid}{<key>}} {NEW} support.
                Added #map goto {{roomid}{<key>}} {DIG} support.

mapper.c        Added the roomid field to map rooms. When using #map goto or
                #map run on a roomid regular expressions cannot be used.
                Roomid's are case sensitive, must be matched exactly, and
                are expected to be unique.

daemon.c        Added #daemon {kill|list}. See #help daemon.

daemon.c        Added #daemon {attach|detach}. See #help daemon.

main.c          Can launch tt++ with the -R argument to reattach.

data.c          Added #info MCCP option.

draw.c          Added TUBED drawing option.

scan.c          Added #scan FILE {commands} option. See #help scan.

map.c           Can provide multiple ; separated commands to #map move at
                once. For example: #map move {n;e;s;w}

main.c          Added support for starting tintin with telnet://host:port

draw.c          Added ANSI, UNICODE, JEWELED and FILLED prefixes.

tables.c        Removed #forall command.

mapper.c        Added #map center <x> <y> <z> to set the center of the map
                viewer, default is 0 0 0.

split.c         Added SCREEN SPLIT and SCREEN UNSPLIT events.

nest.c          Added VARIABLE UPDATED event.

draw.c          Added the BUMPED prefix to prefix a scroll region box with an
                enter. You create a scroll region box by using 0 as the top
                row argument. Treat the other arguments as if the top row
                is set to 1.

draw.c          Finished rounded box drawing, to get the old behavior use
                the CIRCLED prefix.

config.c        Added #config {mouse tracking} {on|off|debug|info|debug info}
                to enable/disable info/debugging for all mouse clicks.
                Use #config {mouse tracking} {on} to reset to normal.

help.c          Updated #help regex to state that %. and %+ should no longer
                be used. This will allow future expansion of tintin's regex
                syntax. Use {.} and {.+} and {.?+} instead.

variable.c      Added support for %+10w and %-10w to #format. Negative numbers
                subtract the given value from the screen width when wrapping.

text.c          Added initial tab displaying support.

config.c        Added TAB WIDTH config option.

nest.c          Added a notice for people still using $variable[] instead of
                *variable[]. I'll change $variable[] eventually to be
                identical to $variable[%*].

math.c          Added .. ellipsis support to define ranges in tables. It can
                also be used in #math to join two 32 bit integers into a 64
                bit integer.

terminal.c      Now initializing a more advanced keyboard mode upon startup,
                if a macro stops working check if you have to redefine it to
                a new sequence.

math.c          By default tintin does a string vs regex comparison when
                using == and !=. Added === and !== to do string vs string
                comparisons.

config.c        Made configurations less lazy, making it easier to detect
                when settings aren't properly inherited or changed globally.

screen.c        Added #screen scroll option, similar to #split but uses square
                notation to define the scroll region.

screen.c        Added #screen fill option.

terminal.c      Added SCREEN ROTATE PORTRAIT and SCREEN ROTATE LANDSCAPE
                events.

mapper.c        #map offset will now rescale along with the window.

split.c         The #split command has been changed to where it sets the
                number of top split lines if only one argument is given.

                The 2nd argument sets the number of bottom split lines which
                defaults to 1. The 3rd and 4th argument set the left and right
                split lines and when used will automatically enable vertical
                split mode.

                Split initalization will use unicode if #config charset is
                set to utf-8

buffer.c        The #buffer get syntax has been changed to treat 1 as the
                oldest line in the buffer, and -1 as the most recent.
                Unfortunately that's not backward compatible, but it's in
                line with the other row behavior changes, so at least it
                will be consistent.

text.c          With #split enabled and #config wordwrap set to a positive
                value tintin++ will attempt a vertical split.

draw.c          More feature complete, see #help draw.

vt100.c         Added better cursor save/restore handling.

update.c        Added support for centisecond delays (0.01) and moved ticks to
                deciseconds (0.1).

                Reduced input and session polling lag from 25 ms to 5 ms,
                which comes at a slight increase in cpu usage.

draw.c          Added TEED prefix for #draw, subsequently #draw middle and
                #draw center have been removed as they did the same and
                were somewhat confusing terms.

misc.c          Added some #bell options, see #help bell.
                #bell {flash|focus|margin|ring|volume} {argument}

variable.c      #format %X now will also take unicode characters as input.
                #echo %X ┓ displays 2513 and #showme \u2513 displays ┓

path.c          #path run no longer uses delays but uses its own timer system,
                you can use #path stop to stop running, and if you enter
                #path run again you'll continue where you stopped.

trigger.c       Named delays are now automatically converted to one shot
                triggers. #undelay will use #untick if the argument begins
                with a letter.

mapper.c        Changed #map destroy to #map destroy {area|world} {arg}

files.c         Added {READ ERROR} and {WRITE ERROR} events.

trigger.c       Added #line oneshot support to all triggers and variables.

line.c          Added #line oneshot to create oneshot triggers. Right now
                only works for #ticker.

line.c          Added #line debug to execute given line in debug mode.

substitute.c    #config color is now taken into account when displaying
                color codes, downgrading colors as needed.

tables.c        When using color names in highlights all lowercase color names
                will be dark by default, while capitalized color names
                will be light. So 'blue' is dark while 'Blue' is light. This
                allows using 'b Blue' for a light blue background.

draw.c          Added the ability to prefix a draw option with a color name
                or color code to draw colored lines and boxes.

Aug 2019        2.01.91
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vt100.c         Added %2 rows %3 cols arguments to the VT100 SCROLL REGION
                event to increase ease of use.

mapper.c        Changed #map at to also take an exit for the location.

data.c          No longer saving or displaying the priority of triggers which
                are set to the default priority.

mapper.c        Added #map map <rows> <cols> draw <square> to draw the map at
                the given location. This is no real alternative for using #map
                offset as #map offset allows mouse map events.

draw.c          Added unicode drawing options.

line.c          Added #line logmode {html|plain|raw} {argument} Allows you
                to execute a command with a temporary logging mode.

mapper.c        Now drawing + and - for muds using nu dn eu ed exits.

macro.c         Added ^ support to macros to make a macro only trigger at the
                start of input. If you want to macro a literal ^ use \^ at
                the start of the line. It behaves very similar to the ~ for
                color triggers.

mapper.c        Improved exit drawing in unicode mode.

draw.c          Added #draw command and #help file.

mapper.c        Added #map update option to force an update of the vtmap. Keep
                in mind the vtmap will only update once every 0.1 seconds.

screen.c        Added #screen clear {split|top|bottom} to clear split lines.

config.c        Added #config {wordwrap {on|off|number} when a number is given
                tintin will wrap at the given width, and will also report the
                given width to MUDs over TELNET.

config.c        Added #config {telnet} {on|off|debug} which allows enabling or
                disabling telnet support. The debug option is the same as
                #config {debug telnet} on and will eventually replace it. To
                disable debug mode use #config telnet on.

help.c          Added #help button

button.c        Added #button.

Jul 2019        2.01.90
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mapper.c        Added MAP FOLLOWED MAP event which triggers on map movement.
                %0 = new vnum %1 = old vnum %2 = exit name. Keep in mind
                that this event isn't triggered when using #map goto.

config.c        Added #config {PACKET PATCH {AUTO} option which currently
                only enables to 0.1 seconds when #split is enabled.

msdp.c          Added MAP_ROOM_INFO msdp event.

math.c          Strings in #if and #math can now be defined using {string}
                instead of "string". The quote syntax will remain valid.

mapper.c        Added #map offset <row> <col> <row> <col> to define a square
                within which the vt map will be printed.

screen.c        Added #screen clear option which allows clearing the screen,
                the scrolling region, or a <row> <col> <row> <col> square.
                For all square operations you must define the top left and
                bottom right corner. Negative numbers are allowed which
                behave identical to #showme.

mapper.c        #map map now allows a very large range and when logging will
                use the configured log mode. This allows generating a large
                html map.

mapper.c        Improved the #map legend interface and made it easier to
                update by using the index number. I haven't added special
                legends for ascii and unicode graphic modes yet.

buffer.c        Added #buffer up 1 and #buffer down 1 to scroll the buffer up
                or down by one line. Values of 2 and higher are allowed as
                well with the maximum set at the screen size.

msdp.c          Added some SCREEN based MSDP events to #port. Renamed a few
                #screen arguments / events to something I was happier with.

chat.c          Added #chat accept <buddy> [boost] option for faster file
                transfer. The boost value must be between 1 and 1000.

screen.c        Added #screen get <top_row|bot_row|top_split|bot_split> <var>

vt100.c         Added VT100 SCROLL REGION event.

main.c          Added SYSTEM ERROR and CATCH SYSTEM ERROR events.

mapper.c        Added #map color symbol option.

files.c         Added accidental overwrite protection when trying to write
                a command file to a .map file. Use {force} to force. It's
                suggested to use .tin files for command files.

mapper.c        Added accidental overwrite protection when trying to save a
                map to a .tin file. Can add the {force} argument to force
                writing anyways. It's suggested to use .map for map files.

mapper.c        Made all map search options require a perfect match. To look
                for a sub string one needs to use #map find {text%*} or
                #map find {%*text%*}

mapper.c        Exits created in the global room should now work without
                needing to set a special alias that performs a #map goto.
                This also means that if you set the exit command on an exit
                in the global room it ought to work.

mccp.c          Enabled MCCP3 for #port which allows two-way compression.
                This should be useful for people who send a lot of data back
                and forth. It uses TELNET option code 87.

port.c          Added initial telnet support to #port. This still needs some
                more work to get MSDP working, and I'm also working on
                the ability to use JSON syntax with MSDP event handling.

telopt_server.c Enabled.

parse.c         Added a debug call for incorrect abbreviation checks.

mapper.c        Added invisible exit flag. It's intended to make exits
                invisible. If you want to make hidden rooms invisible try
                #map color hide <208>

mapper.c        Added up/down exit flag colors in unicodegraphics mode.

screen.c        Added some more screen stuff, see #help screen.

parse.c         Added experimental change where in command lookups a space
                can be substituted with a _ character. For example
                #config {COMMAND ECHO} ON equals #config COMMAND_ECHO ON.

                If this change causes unforseen problems it'll likely be
                reverted.

telopt_client.c No longer sending proper telnet replies for echo due to
                infinite loop problems on a few muds that improperly
                handle telnet negotiations.

mapper.c        Improved void room handling in unicodegraphics mode.

prompt.c        Using #prompt or #showme without a column argument will
                clear the line.

main.c          Improved signal handling.

update.c        The %2 value of TIME events now holds the day of the week
                instead of the week of the year. The value is between 0 and 6
                and specific events for each week day are possible.

update.c        The %3 value of TIME events holds the day of the month. The
                value is between 0 and 31 and specific events for a day of the
                month are now possible.

main.c          Updated system error handling.

mapper.c        Improved #map color command.

mapper.c        Further improved unicodegraphics mode.

mapper.c        Further improved blockgraphics mode.

mapper.c        Added #map color avoid

mapper.c        Added #map color hide

prompt.c        Changed #prompt to use the new {row} {col} input.

mapper.c        Changed the #map map command which now has the syntax:

                #map map {rows} {cols} {append|write|list|variable} {arg}

terminal.c      Changed WINDOW RESIZE %0 to list rows, and %1 to list cols.

event.c         Changed all MOUSE events to %0=row %1=col %2=-row %3=-row

*.c             Currently there are two big problems that need to be addressed
                to continue smooth development.

                1. In VT100 row 1 is the top line, while in tintin row 1 is
                   the split line.
                2. In VT100 row, col (y, x) notation is used, while I've been
                   favoring col, row (x, y) notation.

                While this may seem like a minor issue, I'm utilizing VT100
                more often using more complex operations, and TinTin++ is
                currently pretty much mirrored in the way it behaves. This
                results in relatively simple math becoming weird unintuitive
                math, making already complex code even more complex, resulting
                in bugs and unreadable code that requires a lot of mental
                gymnastics to figure out.

                Subsequently I decided on a major interface change that will
                result in several compatibility issues.

                #split will stay the way it is.

                #showme {text} will stay the same
                #showme {text} {0} will become invalid.
                #showme {text} {1} will print on the top line.
                #showme {text} {-1} will print on the bottom line / input
                   line.
                #showme {text} {-2} will print on the default split line.

                #prompt {text} {substitution} will stay the same and print
                   on the default split line.
                #prompt {text} {substitution} {0} will become invalid.
                #prompt {test] {substitution} {1} will write to the top line.
                #prompt {text} {substitution} {-1} will write to the bottom
                   line / input line.
                #prompt {text} {substitution} {-2} will write to the 2nd line
                   from the bottom, which is the default split line.

                All code that takes {col} {row} as an argument will be changed
                to {row} {col}. The main reason for this change is consistency,
                and because I've repeatedly swapped row and col in VT100 which
                can be a tricky bug to track down.

session.c       Added the 'ats' keyword to the session find routine to return
                the active tintin session.

mapper.c        Fixed the #map map {<width> x <height>} calculations.

buffer.c        When using #snoop on a session #showme and a few other things
                were not displayed. This should be fixed now.

nest.c          Added basic syntax highlighting for variables, only works
                when using #var {variable>

tokenize.c      Added basic syntax highlight for lists, only works when
                using #<list> {list}

help.c          Added TIME help file.

tokenize.c      Fixed a bug with nested #while commands.

port.c          Changed #event {PORT MESSAGE} to {PORT RECEIVED MESSAGE}
                which triggers when a message is received from a connection.

                Added #event {PORT MESSAGE} and {PORT LOG MESSAGE} which
                trigger on internal messages.

                All these can be prefixed with CATCH.

variable.c      Fixed two crash bugs in #format, it remains a somewhat
                vulnerable command, so you should never allow a 3rd party
                argument to set the format string of #format or #echo, though
                parsing 3rd party arguments as a #format/echo argument is safe.

                Safest is to use #line ignore #showme {text} if you want to
                print text that is ignored by triggers.

telopt_server.c Added a TELNET server for #port, it's not hooked up yet,
                but the code merge may have caused some telnet bugs. Please
                report any unusual telnet behavior.

mapper.c        Fixed some issues with #map legend, should be able to use it
                to change the legend now.

buffer.c        Fixed some more scrolling issues.

README          Updated the README file and added the NEWS and docs/syntax.txt
                files. The NEWS file primarily contains a list of changes that
                impact compatibility between versions.

tel_client.c    Fixed CHARSET REQUEST handling.

buffer.c        Fixed longstanding issue with the handling of long lines.




Mar 2019        2.01.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

update.c        Added MAP UPDATED VTMAP event, triggers right after each
                vtmap redraw.

config.c        Added CHILD LOCK config option to disable tintin command
                input. This is useful for people who want to give third
                parties remote access to a tintin++ session.

line.c          Enabled the #line substitute arguments option which has a few
                limited usecases.

main.c          Added better #! hashbang support, with %0 in the PROGRAM START
                event holding all unrecognized launch arguments. %1 holds the
                1st argument (program name), %2 the 2nd argument, etc.

data.c          Added #INFO SYSTEM option, with #INFO SYSTEM SAVE saving the
                data to the info[SYSTEM] variable. Current variables
                supported are CLIENT_NAME and CLIENT_VERSION.

event.c         Added %4 and %5 arguments to mouse click events which hold the
                word and line that was clicked. Under construction.

net.c           Slightly improved traditional prompt handling, but the code
                will need a proper update to work properly.

parse.c         Added UNKNOWN COMMAND event, triggers on #jklfdjl and other
                non-existent commands.

screen.c        Added the #screen command, still under development.

telopt.c        Added VT100 OSC en CATCH VT100 OSC events.

port.c          Fixed an issue with #port and #chat on Mac OS X.

mapper.c        Added #map global which allow setting the vnum of a room that
                contains exits for global transportation commands, like for
                example the recall location.

mapper.c        #added #map roomflag noglobal to indicate rooms that block
                global transportation commands, like norecall rooms.

input.c         Added CATCH RECEIVED INPUT event.
                Added RECEIVED KEYPRESS event.
                Added CATCH RECEIVED KEYPRESS event.

mapper.c        Added support for up/down displaying in blockgraphics mode.

mapper.c        Added #map flag direction to enable/disable the showing of the
                direction arrow in the mapper. Also includes a minor
                modification in the legend.

utf8.c          Added KOI-8 to UTF-8 conversion support, which is enabled with
                #config charset koi2utf

mapper.c        Added #map flag blockgraphics mode, still needs some more
                work.

variable.c      Updated %a to take a UTF-8 sequence and print the
                corresponding 21 bit decimal unicode value. This requires for
                #config CHARSET to be set to an UTF-8 mode to work.

                Updated %A to take a 32 bit decimal value and print the
                corresponding unicode UTF-8 sequence. This requires for
                #config CHARSET to be set to an UTF-8 mode to work.

                Added %x which takes a hexadecimal value and prints the
                corresponding unicode UTF-8 sequence.

                Added %X which convers a 64 bit unsigned decimal value to
                a 64 bit hexadecimal value.

                Added %D which converts a 64 bit hexadecimal value to
                a 64 bit unsigned decimal value.

math.c          Fixed an issue with 63-64 bit math.

mapper.c        Added #map flag unicodegraphics mode.

utf8.c          Added #config charset FANSI option that maps code page 437 to
                UTF-8. Requires an UTF-8 terminal to work and you can try out
                fansi art at 8bit.fansi.org 4201.

main.c          The -s startup option will start tt++ in screen reader mode.

mapper.c        Added support for direction displaying in mudfont mode.

utf8.c          UTF-8 character detection should be synched with xterm.

mapper.c        #map legend is now completely different and supports various
                default legends to choose from, namely:

                [ASCII NESW          ]     [  1]  [ 32]
                [UNICODE NESW        ]     [  1]  [ 32]
                [UNICODE NESW LINE   ]     [  1]  [ 16]
                [UNICODE NESW MISC   ]     [ 17]  [ 24]
                [UNICODE NESW DIRS   ]     [ 25]  [ 32]
                [UNICODE NESW TUBE   ]     [  1]  [ 32]
                [MUDFONT BRAILLE TUBE]     [ 33]  [164]
                [MUDFONT BRAILLE LINE]     [ 33]  [164]
                [MUDFONT PRIVATE     ]     [ 33]  [164]
                [MUDFONT CURVED      ]     [161]  [164]
                [RESET               ]     [  1]  [164]

                The legend exits of 164 characters and when setting for
                example UNICODE NESW DIRS you're only redefining 8 characters
                from position 17 to position 24.

prompt.c        #prompt and #showme now take a 3rd argument that sets the
                column number at which the text is printed. The column number
                must be between 1 and the maximum width of the screen. If a
                negative number is provided the distance is measured from the
                right. The line isn't automatically cleared when using
                #showme with a column argument.

input.c         Added support for fullwidth UTF-8 characters. This won't be
                working perfectly until unicode is better standardized.

config.c        Added #config CHARSET BIG2UTF. When enabled text you receive
                will be translated from BIG-5 to UTF-8, and data you send will
                be translated from UTF-8 to BIG-5. This should allow someone
                to play a BIG-5 mud using an UTF-8 capable terminal.

path.c          Added #path describe to give a basic description of the
                mapped path. Might be of interesting for anyone using a
                screen reader.

utf8.c          Added UTF-8 character width detection.

mapper.c        When #map list is used with a variable the variable is now
                properly cleared. In addition #map list will report the
                relative x y and z coordinates of the found rooms which can
                be used with #map jump. This update changes the table
                structure of the variable returned by #map list.

mapper.c        Added #map legend reset option and fixed legend saving.

mapper.c        Added new mudfont mode based on the braille unicode block.

mapper.c        Changed the RIVER map room flag to CURVED and added support
                for it in simple and mudfont mode.

mapper.c        Added click events that trigger when clicking a room on the
                vt map reporting the room vnum.

session.c       More properly terminating zombie processes after using #run.

telopt.c        Added support for the CHARSET telnet option. Currently
                supporting UTF-8, BIG-5, and FANSI.

path.c          Added #path save <length|position> <variable> options.


Feb 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                There was a question regarding copyright and licensing
                recently so I made some changes and I'm writing this entry to
                clarify a few things.

           1992 Peter Joachim Unold released TINTIN III with the implicit
                right to create derived works and the request for derived
                work to rename the client and clearly state the author. On
                usenet Peter Unold later confirmed that he considered his
                source code release to be public domain.

           1995 Bill Reiss released TinTin++ 1.5 without a copyright notice,
                two mentions of authorship, and the implicit understanding
                that the work is considered public domain with the exception
                of the tintin15.txt manual which is explicitly copyrighted to
                Joann Ellsworth. It is also made clear that derived works
                should not use the name TinTin++.

           2001 David Chan released TinTin++ 1.85 without a copyright notice
                just like all previous TinTin++ releases and 4 mentions of
                having made changes in the source code.

           2001 David Chan and Robert Ellsworth released TinTin++ 1.86 under
                the GPL 2 or later with the 2002 copyright assigned to David
                Chan, Robert Ellsworth, and a reference to the CREDITS file
                on July 12th, 2001.

                David Chan would have been unable to do so legally without the
                explicit permission of Bill Reiss and several other notable
                contributors unless TinTin++ 1.85 which was released without
                a copyright notice or license was considered by all parties to
                be public domain software.

                Subsequently David Chan nor Robert Ellsworth could
                retroactively return copyright to previous authors. However,
                David Chan and Robert Ellsworth could consider themselves,
                and they in fact did, the copyright holders of the public
                domain TinTin++ 1.85 derived GPL 2 licensed software they
                titled TinTin++ 1.86.

                The reason they did this can only be guessed at, but I assume
                they were tired of hosting, developing, and answering
                questions about TinTin++. The easiest way to get the source
                code permanently hosted was by debianizing it, which required
                licensing the code under GPL 2, which could only be done by the
                copyright holder.

           2001 The TinTin++ 1.86 package was debianized by Jordi Mallach
                <jordi@debian.org> on 22 Aug 2001.

           2001 Robert Ellsworth, aka Joann Ellsworth, as the copyright holder
                licensed the tintin15.txt manual under the GPL on 28 Aug 2001.

           2004 Igor van den Hoven received permission from Bill Reiss to
                release TinTin++ derived code under the name TinTin++.

           2004 Igor van den Hoven released TinTin++ 1.90 on March 13 under
                the GPL 2 or later with the 2004 copyright notice referring
                to the CREDITS file. Due to the inclusion of the tintin15.txt
                file the code could only be legally released under the GPL
                2 or later.

                Version 1.90 featured a new mathematics engine and regular
                expression interpreter, telnet negotations, a scroll back
                buffer, enhanced VT102 interpretation, a more standardized
                TINTIN scripting language, a nifty string formatter, internal
                color manipulation, and a back to basics command structure.

                TinTin++ 1.90 contained no source code from TinTin++ 1.86 and
                over 50% of the 1.85 code had been deleted or rewritten.

           2008 Igor van den Hoven released TinTin++ 1.98.3 under the GPL 2
                or later with the copyrighted tintin15.txt manual removed.

                At this point 90% of the code was rewritten and what remained
                was primarily heavily modified code originally written by
                Peter Unold and Bill Reiss.

           2019 Igor van den Hoven released TinTin++ 2.01.8 under the GPL 3
                or later. The copyright of over 99% of the source code is
                held by Igor van den Hoven with minimal contributions from
                others, making him the sole copyright holder.

                TinTin++, as of version 2.01.8, may not be distributed under
                GPL 2, and can only be distributed under GPL 3 or later. The
                reason for this is the exploitation of a serious loophole in
                the GPL 2 license.

                The TinTin++ software as of version 1.87 is NOT public domain,
                as the GPL 2 & 3 licenses explicitly require a legal copyright
                holder in order to legally enforce the license. Nor do I
                desire to relinquish my rights to do as I please with software
                that I've worked on for close to 20 years.

                If anything is unclear feel free to contact me.

Feb 2019       2.01.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class.c        Added proper class nesting. When closing the active class,
               the last active class is activated. This change will cause
               trouble for scripts that don't properly close classes.

class.c        Added #class {class} SIZE {variable} option to store the size
               of a class in a given variable.

event.c        Added the SHORT-CLICKED mouse events. It triggers when the
               time between pressing and releasing the mouse button is
               less than 0.5 seconds. The event is not triggered when
               double or triple clicks occure, but will trigger on the
               first click of a double click, just like a triple click
               event will be preceded by a double click event.

event.c        All mouse events now report the inverse x and y position
               using the %2 and %3 arguments.

event.c        Added the LONG-CLICKED mouse event. It triggers when the time
               between pressing and releasing the mouse button is greater
               than 0.5 seconds.

variable.c     Added better support for wrapping escaped characters with
               #format %w.

path.c         Added #path create, destroy, goto, move start, stop, swap, undo
               which are somewhat document in #help path.

               You can now have a position on a path, which is displayed
               with #path map. This allows using #path move backward when a
               #path walk forward is interrupted.


Jan 2019       2.01.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tinexp.c       Using $$variable in #action triggers is no longer valid. Use
               $variable instead. If the variable needs to be substituted
               right away use:

               #line sub var {#action {$var} {#loop 1 3 cnt #showme $$cnt}}

event.c        Added {DOUBLE-CLICKED} and {TRIPLE-CLICKED} mouse events
               these events trigger on 2 and 3 clicks within 0.5 seconds.
               A triple click will reset the mouse state.

event.c        Added {MOVED }, {PRESSED }, {RELEASED } and {SCROLLED } mouse
               events. Use #INFO EVENT ON to see the full events. The row
               position is reported using the same method as with #prompt.

               For each click three events are generated, one generic one,
               one with the row position as measured from the top, and one
               with the row position as measured from the bottom.

               The MOVED event only triggers when the mouse is moved while a
               button is pressed.

               %0 contains the column and %1 the row.

config.c       Added MOUSE TRACKING config option which enables mouse
               tracking events. While mouse tracking is
               enabled shift needs to be hold in order to select text with
               the mouse if you want to copy and paste text.

cursor.c       Added WINDOW FOCUS IN and WINDOW FOCUS OUT events.

tick.c         Fixed micro delays not getting properly sorted.

event.c        Added #info {events} {on} option to display messages when
               events are thrown. As this can get quite spammy these
               messages can be gagged as well.

gag.c          Added #debug and #info messages for gags.

telopt.c       Renamed all telnet events that prevent the execution of the
               default telnet handling code to CATCH IAC <TELNET CODE> adding
               several events that did not yet exist.

               Telnet events without default handling code like MSDP and GMCP
               were not renamed.

telopt.c       Added better telnet loop protection for echo negotiations.

scan.c         Changed #scan syntax to #scan {ABORT|CSV|TSV|TXT} {filename}

               CSV reads a comma separated file which triggers the
               SCAN CSV HEADER (first line) and SCAN CSV LINE (subsequent
               lines) events. Values containing spaces require quotes, and
               two quotes "" are required to escape a quote.

               TSV reads a tab separated file which triggers the
               SCAN TSV HEADER and SCAN TSV LINE events.

               TXT is an updated and faster version of the old #scan.

               The old #scan syntax is no longer supported.

config.c       Changed the random number generator to 64 bit with each
               session having its own unique seed that can be set with
               #config {random seed}.


Jan 2018       2.01.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

math.c         Fixed bug with floating point math.

line.c         Added #line verbatim option.

cursor.c       Added the #cursor brace open, and #cursor brace close
               commands. This to easily insert the { and } characters from
               within a macro, which currently is rather complicated.

tinexp.c       Added support for <Fxxxxxx> and <Bxxxxxx> 24 bit color codes.
               F stands for foreground, B for background, xxxxxx is a
               hexadecimal RGB value. The terminal must support truecolor
               for these to work.

session.c      Added on|off option to #snoop.

data.c         Added #info {list} {LIST|SAVE} option to list the content of a
               list or save it to a variable.

tokenize.c     Improved trailing space parsing.

mapper.c       Added exit weights.

mapper.c       Added #map get all <var> option.

main.c         Added the -a <argument> startup option, which is passed to the
               %2 variable of the PROGRAM start event.

buffer.c       Added #buffer lock {on|off} option.

session.c      Fixed #port session close being shown as a time out.

tinexp.c       Added \UXXXXXX escape code which takes 6 hexedecimal digits.

tinexp.c       Added \uXXXX escape code, XXXX must be a 4 digit hexadecimal
               unicode index, which is translated to a UTF-8 sequence.

tinexp.c       @ $ * and & characters send from the server are only escaped if
               the key matches an existing variable. Keep in mind that ${ *{
               and &{ are always escaped.


tinexp.c       Added support for <Fxxx> and <Bxxx> 12 bit color codes. F
               stands for foreground, B for background, xxx is hexadecimal RGB
               value. For example <F0F0> will print in bright green. The
               terminal must support truecolor for these to work.

               To use 24 bit truecolor codes use \e[38;2;R;G;Bm where R G B
               are decimal values between 0 and 255. \e[48;2;R;G;Bm will print
               background colors.

path.c         Added support for multiple arguments to #unpathdir.

line.c         #line log {filename} {text} was extremely slow, at least on
               cygwin, because it was opening and closing a file descriptor
               for each log call. Multiple logs to the same file are much
               faster now, with each session having its own dedicated file
               descriptor to speed up consecutive writes to the same log
               file.

config.c       Added config RANDOM SEED option to set a custom seed for the
               random number generator. Useful for machine learning scripts
               and some other obscure stuff.

system.c       Added popen failure check for #script.

mapper.c       Fixed issue with #map undo not properly handling void rooms.

nest.c         Fixed memory issue causing a crash on very large variables.

config.c       Added #config INHERITANCE option. Default is on, set to off
               to prevent triggers from getting inherited. Configurations
               are still inherited from the startup session.

config.c       Added #config CHARSET AUTO option. TinTin++ will try to
               automatically detect UTF-8 and BIG5 encoding.

session.c      SESSION CREATED now triggers after the filename provided with
               #session, #ssl, #run, or #port has been read.

parse.c        Removed dot notation support for variables. #var bla.bli blo
               is no longer valid, nor is $bla.bli. The code didn't add any
               functionality while it was causing all kinds of issues. Sorry
               for the inconvenience, not one of my brightest ideas.


telopt.c       Updated MTTS to report SCREEN READER setting.

config.c       Added SCREEN READER config option.

telopt.c       Updated MTTS to report the ANSI, 256, and TRUE color setting.

config.c       Replaced 256 COLOR config with COLOR MODE config option,
               options are AUTO, NONE, ANSI, 256, or TRUE.

vt102.c        Added truecolor COLOR PATCH support. Not well tested so far.

log.c          Added truecolor html logging.

input.c        No longer spawning blank lines with #config {command echo}
               off, if you want the old behavior you can set your command
               color to <008> or <aaa>.

tinexp.c       Added %! as a regular expression option to prevent the auto
               capturing of a match. For example %!*, %!w, %!d etc.

               %!{ } can be used to the same effect to embed a regular
               expression without automatically adding paranthesis.

tinexp.c       Added an exception so %*{text} is treated as a regular
               expression instead of a variable. As of the last version
               *{text} is a valid variable.

variable.c     Added the %H #format option to generate a 32 bit hash for the
               given string.

substitute.c   Fixed argument substitution problem.

main.c         Can use #end {\} to terminate tintin silently.

system.c       Added #scan abort option


Oct 2017       2.01.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.c         Added proper greeting handling for narrow terminals, mainly for
               people using tt++ on an android phone.

variable.c     Added proper \ handling in string length calculations.

variable.c     #unvariable takes additional arguments to unvar several
               variables at once.

tinexp.c       Added support for *{variable} to show variable/table keys. This
               is useful when low level data processing is needed.

               For example, *{+1} shows the key of the first variable.

list.c         Added #list {var} simplify {variable} option which saves a
               list (which internally is a table) as a semi-colon separated
               list to the provided destination variable.
               {{1}{bli}{2}{bla}{3}{blo}} becomes {bli;bla;blo}


May 2017       2.01.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mapper.c       Added #map legend support to assign custom characters for
               the #map flag MUD FONT display mode. By default they're set
               to map to the unicode private use area.

mapper.c       By default an UTF-8 #map legend is created for those who do
               not use ASCII graphics. The ANSI legend was pretty much
               unusable and most terminals are supporting UTF-8 now. Windows
               does not support all box drawing characters, hopefully this
               will be fixed in the future.

mapper.c       Removed support for the vtgraphics drawing mode which worked
               on very few terminals.

utils.c        Verbosity is automatically enabled for debug mode to avoid
               logging inconsistencies.

port.c         Added #port command, similar to netcat.

chat.c         #chat prefix works now

math.c         Better #math debug through #debug VARIABLE on

mapper.c       Added map exit <dir> dir <number> option.

action.c       Fixed action crash bug that slipped in

telopt.c       Added telnet events for IAC GA and IAC EOR


Jun 2015       2.01.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mapper.c       Added map <radius> <variable name> {v} option to save the map
               output to a variable.

log.c          html log files now correctly set the charset to UTF-8 or big5
               if applicable.

tokenize.c     Added support for local variables with the #LOCAL command. Most
               commands that manipulate variables will use a local variable
               if it has been declared.

utils.c        Fixed crash bug on substitutions on system messages.

session.c      Showing all connect retry attempts and seconds left.

session.c      Any manual input while connecting will cancel connect retry.

main.c         Can create macros for ctrl-d and ctrl-z again.

mapper.c       Added #map color background option to set a background color
               for the map display.

variable.c     Added optional width argument to #format %w. Also added UTF-8
               support to %w.

variable.c     Attempt to fix %p crash bug on OS X.

               Fixed compilation issue for OS X.


Jan 2014       2.01.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

chat.c         Added CHAT MESSAGE event, %0 contains the chat color and prefix,
               %1 omits chat color and prefix.

chat.c         Added #chat prefix option.

mapper.c       Can now provide multiple flags at once when using
               #map roomflag and #map insert.

line.c         Added #line quiet option.

cursor.c       Fixed tab bug with multi-word tabs.

event.c        Fixed bug with events defined in multiple sessions.

tinexp.c       Added @<session name>{<substitution>} option to perform a
               function-like substitution in another session and retreive
               the result. Primarily useful for getting variables.

highlight.c    Added no-blink no-underscore and no-reverse #highlight options.

highlight.c    Added option to use escape codes in the #highlight color field.

class.c        Added #class {<class>} list {<list>} option.

map.c          Added #map list {roomflag} option.

list.c         Fixed bug with using #list clear on a nested variable.

substitute.c   Added patch by Nya to properly handle colored substitutions.

math.c         Added // operator to calculate sqrt // 2 or cbrt // 3

math.c         Added ** operator to calculate power

tinexp.c       Added IGNORE options to variables and functions.

main.c         The command history is automatically saved again.

ssl.c          Added SSL support based on KBTin code by Adam Borowski.

tinex.c        $ @ and & are now escaped when received as part of an action for
               added security.

session.c      Added SESSION CREATED event.

parse.c        Fixed command echoing when executing commands in another session.

Mar 2013       2.01.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

session.c      #session takes a filename as an additional argument, if the
               session succesfully connects the file will be read.

variable.c     Fixed #echo {%f} {5 / 3} handling.

cursor.c       Added #cursor get and #cursor set options.

parse.c        Added support for nesting using the . argument.

mapper.c       Added map_search_compile option, increasing search speed.

list.c         Added #list TOKENIZE option.

cursor.c       Fixed the cursor PASTE BUFFER option.

event.c        Added the VARIABLE UPDATE <VAR> event.

cursor.c       Added stripping of semi-colons when auto tabbing.

configure.in   Better error handling by Slysven.

Mar 2012       2.00.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

line.c         Added a #line strip option to strip color and escape codes.

session.c      Added SESSION TIMED OUT event.

variable.c     Fixed substitution problem with #unvariable.

mapper.c       Added support for a {variable} argument to #map list to store
               the returned data into a variable. Using {roomname} and
               other keywords from #map set will work as well.

mapper.c       Added #map exit <dir> save to store exit data in a variable.

mapper.c       Added basic color compression support.

mapper.c       Fixed the #map legend display in vtgraphics mode.

mapper.c       Added automatic initialization of a UTF-8 based legend when
               creating a map with #config CHARSET set to UTF-8.

mapper.c       Fixed unnecessary redrawing of the VT map.

list.c         Now properly handles nested arguments.

mapper.c       Fixed a bug with path finding related to weighted rooms.

mapper.c       Added #map flag symbolgraphics option to display the room symbol
               instead of a drawing symbol when in non asciigrahpics mode.

mapper.c       Added #map color here option to set the color of the current
               location.

mapper.c       Fixed a path finding issue related to the avoid flag.


Sep 2011       2.00.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.c         No more advertisements.

mapper.c       Back to void rooms only being allowed two exits, as handling
               multi-exit void rooms adds too much complexity.

mapper.c       Updated the fill_map routine to use breadth-first initialization
               which should significantly improve execution times.

prompt.c       Added proper UTF-8 string length checking for prompt drawing.

mapper.c       Room names are no longer automatically set on creation.

mapper.c       Added the #map vnum command to change the current vnum.

mapper.c       #map link now requires the 'both' argument for a two-way exit
               to be created.

variable.c     Added support to #format for %f to print floating point numbers.

variable.c     Fixed color spacing bug in #format's %s handling.

mapper.c       Added terrain as a searchable option to #map list, goto, find,
               and run.

mapper.c       Added roomweight to the #map get and #map set options. By
               default the weight of a room is set to 1.0 and can be anywhere
               from 0.001 to 1000. The path finder will favor rooms with a low
               weight.

mapper.c       Made the layout of #map info more aesthetically pleasing and
               added the listing of entrances.

substitute.c   Fixed bug where functions could overwrite the original
               substitution's arguments.

highlight.c    Added support for xterm 256 color names, dark azure, dark ebony,
               dark jade, dark lime, dark orange, dark tan, dark silver, dark
               violet, light azure, light ebony, light jade, light lime, light
               orange, light tan, light silver, light violet.

variables.c    Added the %A #format option which prints the corresponding ASCII
               value of the given character. Useful for low level string
               handling.


Apr 2011       2.00.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.c         Added -s option to launch tt++ with a custom seed, undocumented
               till I get to think it over.

math.c         Improvements to #switch.

telopt.c       Added basic low level VT100 stripping for answer back codes.

telopt.c       Added MSDP array support.

mapper.c       Added a set and get option to #map exit that stores and
               retrieves from a data field.

mapper.c       Added the terrain and data fields to #map set and #map get. The
               data field is intended to contain a table, eliminating the need
               for future extensions.

system.c       When using #run followed by #zap the created child process will
               be properly killed instead of left to hang as a zombie process.

tick.c         When setting a delay the final delay time is echoed.

event.c        Added some extra security to event triggers.

telopt.c       Added MTTS support. On a third TTYPE request MTTS will be
               reported followed by a bitvector that indicates whether ANSI,
               VT100, UTF-8, and 256 colors are enabled. The UTF-8 and 256
               color settings can be configured by the user. VT100 is reported
               as disabled if #split mode is enabled - this because the split
               screen mode needs to be disabled for server side VT100
               interfaces to work.

system.c       Added some extra security to the #script command.

system.c       Changed the #script command to behave like a two argument
               command in preperation of removing the rather awkward
               single argument support.

line.c         Added #line ignore option to execute a command without
               checking any triggers.

config.c       Added a 256 COLOR option. When called with auto it'll guess at
               the terminal's 256 color capabilities.

variable.c     When setting a variable the final variable definition is echoed.

variable.c     Added support for BIG5 and UTF8 string formatting.

cursor.c       Added support for BIG5 and UTF8 input handling.

config.c       Added session based BIG5 and UTF8 #config CHARSET option.

substitute.c   Fixed word boundary matching for substitutions.

highlight.c    Fixed word boundary matching for highlights.

nest.c         Math is no longer performed on table keys, mainly to reduce
               annoying false positives, and because the behavior can be
               scripted with math functions. Math is still performed when
               looking up an index.

path.c         Renamed #path map to #path show, #path map still works, but it
               doesn't properly describe what the command does.

path.c         Added #path unzip option that'll load a speedwalk.

line.c         #line logverbatim is now fully verbatim.

log.c          Added a #log off option. #log append and overwrite can now be
               called while logging is already enabled.


Jan 2011       2.00.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

buffer.c       Added better multi-line scroll back handling when word wrap is
               disabled.

telopt.c       Braces are now properly converted in raw gmcp data.

highlight.c    Fixed a bug causing only the first highlight on a line to
               trigger.

line.c         Added a #line {verbose} {<commands>} option which forces
               verbosity on the given commands.

buffer.c       The first match for #buffer find is now 1 instead of 0.

buffer.c       Added support for negative page numbers, causing #grep to search
               from the beginning to the end of the scroll back buffer. The
               first page is now page 1 instead of page 0.

buffer.c       Added a NULL check to prevent possible crashes, not ideal as it
               hides an underlying bug.

net.c          Added the RECEIVED OUTPUT event with %0 containing the received
               output from the server. Can be used to create multi-line
               triggers, though it wouldn't be very efficient.

main.c         No longer enabling DECCKM on startup so keypad mode works
               correctly with MinTTY, it should also result in more reliable
               cross-terminal behavior. This might change the sequence of key
               presses on some systems, so remap macros that stop working.

mapper.c       Added #map resize <size> option to increase the maximum number
               of rooms.

mapper.c       Added #map get worldsize option.

mapper.c       Added #map get worldflags option and fixed some displaying issues
               in the #map exit command.

update.c       Added several time events, YEAR, MONTH, WEEK, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE,
               SECOND, DATE mm-dd, DATE mm-dd hh:mm, TIME hh:mm, TIME hh:mm:ss.

               Events like YEAR 2012, MONTH 04, HOUR 13, are valid as well.

               %0 to %6 hold year, month, week, day, hour, minute, and second
               for each event.

math.c         Added support for automatic dd:hh:mm:ss time to second
               conversion. For example, #math test 1:12:32:17 would store
               131537 in test. #delay 10:00 #bell would ring the terminal bell
               after 10 minutes. This change will effect associative arrays
               consisting of numbers and colons.

tinexp.c       Updated #replace to support regular expressions. Like with the
               #regex command the &1..&99 arguments can be used.


Oct 2010       2.00.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

session.c      Fixed split settings not getting properly inherited from the
               startup session.

advertise.c    Updated with 2011 sponsors.

system.c       do_script() and do_system() now call refresh_terminal(), this
               due to php calls messing up the terminal settings.

terminal.c     Added the refresh_terminal() function which will reset the
               terminal settings to the tintin default.

mapper.c       Fixed the MAP EXIT ROOM event, it was reporting the next room
               rather than the current room for %0. %1 now holds the new room,
               and MAP ENTER ROOM will hold the old room in %1.

mapper.c       Added the option to make vnum specific events, like MAP EXIT ROOM
               42 or MAP ENTER ROOM 27.

vt102.c        Fixed bug in the VT102 state handler.

mapper.c       Added the option to provide a vnum for #map delete.

tokenize.c     Fixed a bug with the verbose state being lost when starting a
               new session using an alias.

tinexp.c       Fixed a bug with embedded variables not getting substituted when
               used in nested variables.


Aug 2010       2.00.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tokenize.c     Added a better verbatim and verbosity handler to more
               generically deal with aliases and input triggered events.

mapper.c       Several mapper messages are no longer displayed when used in
               scripts.

vt102.c        Added proper \e[0;0r VT100 handling.

telopt.c       Added IAC DONT TTYPE handling, allowing servers to reset the
               TTYPE negotiation state.

telopt.c       Added support for cycling through terminal types. On the first
               TTYPE request TINTIN++ is reported, on the second request the
               TERM environment variable is reported.

misc.c         #zap now takes an optional argument to zap a specific session.

text.c         When UTF8 is defined in tintin.h UTF8 characters should get
               wordwrapped correctly.

telopt.c       Added support for module like MSDP events.

mapper.c       Added #map uninsert <direction> command which does the exact
               opposite of the insert command.

               (fairly) safely using: #undelay PATH %d
               This will also work for #map run {location} {delay}

               be echoed without triggering any actions or events.

mapper.c       When setting an exit command it will work like an alias when
               in that room.

               correctly with empty variables. I originally added the "0"
               response for if checks, but this is obsolete with the
               much more reliable &variable[] call.

buffer.c       Added a check to avoid a potential crash on displaying the
               scrollback buffer in show_buffer(), needs a better fix but I

mapper.c       Now using spatial coordinates from pathdirs. This requires
               users to reset their saved pathdirs. If used correctly mapping
               should work for muds with a non standard exit system.

               some minor improvements over the readline version.

utils.c        Added ins_sprintf function that properly inserts a string
               within another strong. Has formatting capabilities.

rl.c           Moved to update.c

*.c            Tintin is now officially lib readline free. Good riddance.
               The binaries are 40% smaller.

tinexp.c       Added 256 xterm color support using <aaa> to <fff> with rgb
               values. Background colors are set with <AAA> to <FFF>

               flags on gts->flags.

cursor.c       Added cursor_redraw_line routine which adds readline input
               scrolling behavior. Tintin will probably work quite poorly on
               non VT100 terminals now.

tables.c       Added list flags to work around the fact that I use lists for
               stuff they weren't originally intended for. Updated list parsers
               throughout the source code.

               legenda is: 250 223 222 200 220 186 201 204 221 188 205 202 187
               185 203 206 246

               rooms going ne, nw, se, sw, u, and d.

misc.c         Can no longer use commas in #loop. When using 1 argument with
               #loop it's assumed

misc.c         Can now use math in delays, as in #delay 1d5 smile.

mapper.c       Added the void roomflag which can be used to turn rooms into
               links. This is mainly useful to fit overlapping areas on the
               same map without using the hide flag.

               places the scrollback buffer at the given search string.

tinexp.c       Can now add lists of keywords between square brackets divided
               by seperators, for example [his|her|its] in actions. The actual
               text is stored in the next %0-9. Cannot be used for highlights.

list.c         array_fnd function allows searching for words in lists.

path.c         can now save loaded paths backward.

               disconnects hanging tintin.

config.c       Added #config {log level} {low|high} which is a hidden config
               option. Defaults to high, when set to low tintin will log the
               raw mud output.


August 2006    1.96.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

misc.c         Placed the functions in alphabetic order and added #SEND which
               will send the given argument directly to the mud. Useful for
               sending escape sequences because you cannot start a mud
               command with an escape sequence.

scrsize.c      If in character mode tintin depreps the terminal temporarily
               when sending NAWS. Yet another annoying readline bug.

chat.c         Added DND (do not disturb) feature. When enabled tintin will
               no longer accept new chat connections.

               Fixed a bug in the DNS lookup routine for addresses starting
               with a number.

               deal with auto ip bans.

parse.c        Complex multi words aliasses are now possible.

data.c         Priority lists are now sorted alphabetically per priority level
class.c        #class class read <file> no longer parses files for the given
               class. The code was too messy to maintain. Instead it'll open
               the class, read the file, and close the file.

alias.c        Added support for complex multi word aliasses.

chat.c         Added #chat public option, accepts the all argument.

chat.c         Added #forward all which included session output
chat.c         Added #color which sets the default color
chat.c         Added a boost option for #chat accept to quadruple download
               speeds, might cause file corruption on bad connections.

class.c        Rewrote some code, #unclass should work now.

data.c         Issueing #tick {name} twice will now reset the ticker.

math.c         Fixed invalid input handling.

misc.c         Snooping a non existant session no longer crashes tintin.


March 2006     1.95.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

buffer.c       While the concept works the code should be more solid. Fixed
               some bugs in the buffer code causing scrolling to crash
               on long help files.

buffer.c       Added a #buffer lock option which resembles scroll lock.

log.c          Fixed a bug in #log append which caused it to not generate
               html headers.

chat.c         Modified the threaded chat functions to minimize accessing
               global data.

               crash the client.

chat.c         #chat who now shows user flags
parse.c        Removed old code that allowed using " " instead of { } in
               a couple of commands such as #format. While I used it in
               some example scripts the code is causing problems.

data.c         Can now use #unmacro by exactly matching the macro instead of
               having to use \\ for a single \.

input.c        TinTin now enables character mode with echo off and SGA enabled.


December 2005  1.95.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.c         Added a command reference table to speed up the processing of
               commands slightly.

               substituted now, allowing variables as variable names.

parse.c        No longer sending message spam when using an alias
buffer.c       Fixed a long standing crash bug in the buffer cleanup routine.

tinexp.c       Now matching arguments in triggers like the old tintin did. This
               will interfere with a couple of triggers but shouldn't be too
               big a problem. %0 to %9 will capture the smallest possible
               amount of text instead of the biggest.

telopt.c       IAC EOR and GA spams are dealt with better with {debug telnet}
               enabled.

telopt.c       Dealing with packet fragmentation in the odd case an IAC EOR or
               GA code is split, not sure if it works since it's hard to test.

               systems.

misc.c         #debug all log, logs debug info without displaying it.

Makefile.in    make install now copies tt++ to /usr/bin

               instead of exiting the program.

chat.c         Added back the chat module that was originally included with
               version 1.86. I pretty much rewrote it while at it.

configure      BIG5 configuration was giving me issues on slackware.

               Since I didn't feel like figuring out how the script works
               I changed it from --enable-big5 to --big5 and fiddled with
               the script till it seemed to work again.


July 2005      1.95.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tinexp.c       Now substituting functions and arguments (if needed) in a
               function's argument list.

tinexp.c       Ending a command with \ will escape the EOL (\r\n) which won't
               be appended to the end of the line. Same story for #showme.

telopt.c       Added negotiating of EOR (end of record).

telopt.c       IAC GA and EOR will now be seen as prompt markers.

files.c        Now skipping chinese characters in #read


July 2005      1.95.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data.c         Added option to use 'all' in #message, #ignore, and #debug to
               toggle everything at once.

files.c        Removed the #writesession command, it's obsolete with the new
               #class command.

class.c        #class write now adds #class open/close to the begin and end
               of the file.

files.c        Cleaned up a bunch of confirmation messages and made them
               gaggable.

tab.c          Variables and functions in a #tab are now substituted at
               evaluation time.


Juny 2005      1.95.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

files.c        If the bracing level is off in the last line tintin reports
               the correct line instead of 0.

rl.c           reading the default readline init file when leaving tintin.
               Should help with a couple of shells not handling this properly.

echo.c         removed some experimental code that ended up causing double
               echoing when switching between sessions.

split.c        fixed screen switching for muds with native vt102 interfaces.

session.c      added #session {-|+|number} options to switch between sessions.

files.c        no longer showing output while using #scan to speed things up
               for huge log files.

misc.c         Added #return which used in an #if check allows bailing out of
               a semicolon seperated command string. If used in a #function
               you can also add an argument to it to set the result, as
               opposed to setting the $result variable directly.


June 2005      1.95.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

macro.c        Added prompt handling for macro's. Still not perfect.

scrsize.c      Fixed resetting of split data when resizing the screen.

split.c        Now drawing split lines on all static regions to increase
               clarity for newbies.

misc.c         Can now use #showme {text} {row}, with a row number given
               #showme will act like #prompt.

misc.c         Can use #echo {{format} {row}} {{arguments}} as well.

rl.c           Fixed #snoop messing up in #split mode.

parse.c        Got rid of the code seperating high and low priority actions,
               no longer valid with the #gagline command.

antisubstitute Removed antisubstitutions since there seems little reason to
               ever need them.

rl.c           Checking internal messages for prompt gags now


May 2005       1.94.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

files.c        Added #scan {filename} which will read in a file and send it to
               the screen as if it was send by a mud. This allows one to view
               raw color logs, turn on logging and save the file in a different
               format, as well as adding gags and other text filters to make
               things more readable. I set the default logging mode to raw
               since ansi log files can now be converted to html ones.

data.c         updatenode_list was acting odd, fiddled with it till it stopped
               crashing. Not sure what the problem was.


May 2005       1.94.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rl.c           Fixed packet patch, and added a default patcher for split mode.
               Fixed the displaying of #alias, #action, etc.


May 2005       1.94.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.c         Fixed #split mode being handled correctly when suspending a
               session.

data.c         Removed excessive color usage when displaying triggers which was
               resulting in crashes.

rl.c           No longer clearing the screen when exiting tintin++.

table.c        Added flags for commands, so far only automatically substituting
               variables and functions for commands that have the sub flag.


May 2005       1.94.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rl.c           Now adding all keyboard input to the scrollback buffer.

rl.c           When in #split mode with no #prompt defined tintin tries to
               mimic normal behavior, which includes placing input at the
               end of the prompt.

prompt.c       #prompt matched lines are now written to the scrollback buffer,
               to simulate the old behavior make an #action executing #gagline.


May 2005       1.94.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rl.c           Fixed a bug that caused prompts to be printed twice.

debug.c        Fixed possible crash from overloading the debug stack.

variable.c     Added #debug messages for #replacestring and #format.

split.c        Fixed various #split bugs when creating or switching sessions.

buffer.c       #buffer {i} will now give some info about the scrollback buffer.

tick.c         #delay now works in the startup session. Tickers are still
               disabled.

class.c        #class <class> read <file>, now only reads in stuff that belongs
               to the given class name. Hence in order for this to work you
               need #class <class> open, and #class <class> close, calls in
               the file itself for this to work.

help.c         Removed David Chan from the credit screen shown when starting
               up TinTin++. I'm sure he had the best intentions, but he spend
               two years making insignificant changes, fiddling with variables,
               adding patches written by others, before vanishing into thin air.


April 2005     1.94.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tintin.h       Now using strtoll instead of atoll since old platforms only
               support strtoll.

telopt.c       With #config {CONVERT META} set to ON mud output will have
               it's meta characters translated, this to aid in making color
               triggers.

split.c        Using #split 0 0 will create an input line without the split
               line. Useful for people who don't use #prompt.


April 2005     1.94.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

log.c          Now flushing the log stream after every call so tailing a log
               file is an option.

class.c        Finished the #class command.

split.c        placed #prompt stuff in prompt.c.

tinexp.c       Added option to start a trigger with ~ in which case colors
               are included in string comparisons and substitutions.

buffer.c       Removed the #writebuffer command, must now use:
               #buffer {write} {filename}


May 2005       1.94.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rl.c           Internal messages are now printed to both the logfile and
               scrollback buffer.

rl.c           Fixed internal messages bumping the screen while scrolling in
               locked mode.

rl.c           Fixed a bug with displaying text that slipped in.

buffer.c       Added the option to use #buffer h/u/d/e for scrolling.

tintin.h       Removed unused macro DEFAULT_FILE_DIR.

utils.c        utime() function doesn't work correctly on cygwin, changed it's
               behavior to guarantee unique time stamps.

buffer.c       No longer writing #grep output the the scrollback buffer
main.c         Now clearing last command (often quit) when starting up tintin++
config.c       Turned #debugtelnet command into a hidden config option.

               Added a hidden config option named CONVERT META, which turns key
               presses into macro readable keyboard input.

class.c        Added basic support for classes, which is grouping for real.
tables.c       Set substitute priority to save correctly.


May 2005       1.94.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

log.c          Added the option for a second argument to the #logline command.
               If second argument is used it will instead print the given line
               to file.

variable.c     Added %G thousandgroupingstring function to format to change
               for example 1000 into 1,000.


May 2005       1.94.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rl.c           mainloop now uses a threaded call for the old mainloop. This
               because the readline() function is blocking and I'm too lazy
               to code the stuff readline takes care of.
               The new mainloop tries to go at 100 loops per second.

session.c      Got rid of connect_delay for connecting sessions. Now using
               1 timer.

tick.c         Changed #ticker to use floating point precision.

               Added delay command: #delay {seconds delay} {command}

variable.c     #format, added %L to print the argument's string length, and
               %U to print the number of micro seconds since epoch, increased
               the number of arguments from 10 to 20.

misc.c         Removed the #sleep command, never worked well and should be
               obsolete with the #delay command.

misc.c         #gagline, when called within an action it will gag the line.

rl.c           The #snoop code wasn't working, fixed it up.

data.c         Increased the buffer of show_list a little to avoid an overflow

macro.h        Changed how macros work, fixing problems like needing a \n at
               the end, needing an empty line, macros being added to the
               command history. Still can't find a way to have rl erase macros.

               Players can enter a command within a line of text using
               [[ command ]].
               Example: tell bubba (long line) [[chat hi bibbi]] (more text)

rl.c           Added the option to delay displaying and parsing possibly broken
               packets. Delay in micro seconds can be set with the PACKET PATCH
               config option. By default it's set to 0 (disabled).

variables.c    Fixed #replacestring which got messed up while I added variable
               substitution to it.

rl.c           Fixed echoing of commands in split mode.

split.c        Changes split and prompt to work more logical, people might
               have to change their scripts, new syntax:
               #split {number of top lines} {number of bottom lines}
               default equals: #split {0} {1}
               Fixed possible color bleeding in the split line, this for noobs
               who don't know how to use tintin's color codes.

files.c        /* and */ now only work when used outside braces.

rl.c           No more threading, made tintin crashy as well.

variable.c     Added %n (name) to #format, which capitalizes the first letter
               of the given string.

buffer.c       No longer resetting the buffer if the new scrollback size
               is the same as the old one.

rl.c           prompts automatically get a newline added in split mode.

session.c      Fixed problem with aliasses changing focus.

rl.c           Made #snoop output non triggerable.

misc.c         Added the $loop and $forall variables set in the #loop and
               #forall commands. Avoids dodgy &0 behavior in #functions.

telopt.c       Added dynamic allocation of buffer space for mccp and the
               normal output buffer.

rlhist.c       1 character long commands are once again added to the command
               history.

files.c        If a bracket is missing TinTin gives a hint at what line the
               error might be.

tinexp.c       Added option to surround a variable with brackets.

variables.c    Removed restrictions on variable names.

math.c         Fixed bug with #if returning the wrong session pointer.

log.c          Added #logline command for actions to log 1 line of text
rlhist.c       If no repeat match is found an error message is printed.

parse.c        Added a check to ingore a trailing ';'.

data.c         Increased buffer size for displaying aliasses.

config.c       Changed packet patch config option from micro to milli seconds.

files.c        Changed calls to isblank() (GNU only) with isspace()
files.c        Only stripping leading spaces now, so #var bla { } will work
               once again.

files.c        I got tired of confusing readnew and readold, so I removed
               readold.


February 2005  1.93.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

split.c        Fixed infinite loop in do_unprompt

rl.c           Added the option to call show_message() with a NULL argument
               for more generic usage.

tintin.h       Set BUFFER_SIZE to 10000 OUTPUT_SIZE to 65000
               and FILE_SIZE to 150000

files.c        Added option to #read and #write using a variable.

buffer.c       Fixed some dodgy behavior of the scroll back buffer, it should
               scroll ultra fast as well now.

               The buffer command now only prints the last screen worth of
               text, too lazy to re-code floating screen indexes atm.
               Added scroll lock to the config menu, to freeze the screen
               while scrolling.


February 2005  1.93.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tick.c         Took care of uninitalized tickers firing prematurely.

session.c      Added option to make a trigger on session termination.

files.c        Added a check for #read being used on a directory.

rl.c           Fixed home/end keys being bound correctly.

split.c        Allowing multiple prompt triggers to fire on the same line
               Fixed split line being 4 '-' short


December 2004  1.93.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tinexp.c       Now only converting ; to : for actions, not for aliasses etc.

path.c         Made END OF PATH message triggerable.

variable.c     added the do_internal_variable command, which does the same
               as do_variable, but allows to set a blank variable. Used by
               do_format and do_replacestring.

rl.c           added the show_message function which only shows messages from
               setting aliasses, variables, etc when called from the command
               line, unless debug is enabled.

rl.c           Now using the more_output buffer previously only used by the
               scrollback buffer to double check actions.


December 2004  1.93.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

net.c          Fixed a crash bug that slipped in with hiding passwords.

net.c          Commands are now added to the buffer/log files while in split
               mode.

highlight.c    Fixed bug with variables and functions not being used.
               Finished highlight code, it no longer messes up old colors.


October 2004   1.93.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

files.c        Added the option to comment using /* comment */ in script files.

math.c         Upgraded to do 64 bit instead of 32 bit operations.

variables.c    Added the replacestring command.

mapper.c       Added the function find_coord, which tries to find a room at the
               given coordinate, starting room being 0,0,0


October 2004   1.93.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

math.c         Fixed a crash bug that slipped in.

tinexp.c       Set \[ to escape as { and \] to escape as }.

main.c         Now setting application keypad mode and ESC 0 prefix on startup.

telopt.c       Changed dont_oldenviron response to wont_oldenviron response,
               reported to fix the ability to login on some server types.


September 2004 1.93.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

log.c          Fixed a typo that broke the log command, as well as adding
               newlines to plain logging.

rlhist.c       one letter commands are no longer added to the history.


August 2004    1.93.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mapper.c       added the redit command, for basic mapper manipulation, still
               needs a bit more work.

telopts.c      Added a telnet patch from Julia Longtin which adds the basic
               telopt negotiations to initialize a telnet session when
               connecting to port 23.

rl.c           Seeming the readline_echoing_p is reset to TRUE whenever
               something is written to the terminal, so I simply set it to
               whatever it should be several times a second now in the main
               loop.


July 2004      1.93.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tintin.h       added a room and exit structure for an auto mapper.

mapper.c       added a creation functions for rooms and exits.

files.c        added the #readmap function to read in a map.

mapper.c       added a routine to display an ascii map.

mapper.c       added an algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two
               rooms.

main.c         the verbatimchar is set as \\ instead of \ as default, this to
               allow escaping braces at a later date with this config option
               causing trouble.


June 2004      1.93.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

log.c          added variable substitution to *arg.

misc.c         added variable substitution to *arg.

parse.c        changed escape character behavior, #format will need %+4s
               instead of %4s if used in an argument or action. Used to
               be possible to use \%4s but that's no good.

tinexp.c       \a \e \n \r \t are now translated to the according characters.
               (\a equals what #bell does, \r\n would equal #cr, \e is ESC)

parse.c        removed premature stripping of '\' character in the parsing
               routines. Escaped characters are dealt with when data is send
               to the mud or screen.


April 2004     1.92.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

misc.c         removed speedwalk command, it's a config option anyways.


March 2004     1.91.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

parse.c        made sure $variables are substituted in the parsing command,
               as well as $vars being substituted as session A passes a
               command to session B. Otherwise variables remain variable
               untill the final execution stage.

data.c         Added nesting syntax highlighting for lists.

math.c         Added support for "T" and "F" (feature was lost in rewrite)

math.c         Added the 'd' operator for a random dice roll

config.c       rewrote some basic stuff in the configuration routines,
               the original setup was a bit dodgy.

highlight.c    Added priorities to highlighting

substitute.c   Added priorities to substitutions

split.c        Added check so a prompt isn't shown for background sessions.

variable.c     Added %R and %C to #format for nr of rows and columns


March 2004     1.90.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

misc.c         added a higher precision to the #sleep command, you can now
               enter #sleep 0.5 to sleep for half a second, precision is in
               miliseconds. Also using nanosleep now, with additional support
               to continue sleeping.

variables.c    added %t to #format, which will print the epoch time.
               added %T to #format, which will print the military time
               of the provided number as: hours:minuts
               added %d to #format, which will print the military data of the
               provided number as: day:month:year (if there's no such thing
               as a military date I hope you still know what I mean).

rl.c           set tintin to 100 loops per second, might seem too much, but
               it doesn't matter cpu wise, and it's always fun when tintin's
               triggers beat those of most other client.

math.c         added + - ! and ~ to the mathexp interpreter.

regexp.c       added color support. codes are entered as <abc> and is pretty
               much translated as : \e[a;b+30;c+40m with '8' counting as
               a skipped color code. People can write their own functions to
               make tintin display colors of their own choice.

variables.c    added %R to #format, which will print a number between 1 and
               the given number in the argument. Removed #random command.
               added %m to #format, which will do the same as #math

regexp.c       added option for end of line terminator ^ so adding ^ to the
               end of the line will make tintin return false if the regexp
               returns with an unfinished match string.

main.c         I update the credit screen, figured it would appropriate to
               put my own name on it after all this work. I turned it into
               a helpfile while at it, #help credits should show it.

regexp.c       made the substitute recursively double check variables and
               functions if they hold a variable of a different kind, useful
               for variables or functions holding color codes.

misc.c         added ignore and debug commands, debug won't do an aweful lot
               as of yet though.

variable.c     figured I should add some more color support, so added a way
               to format tintin color names, using #format %c {name}

variable.c     #format again, %h will create a tintin header line.

variable.c     fixed how variable assignment was being dealt with in triggers,
               can now change and display variables correctly on the fly.

rlhist.c       changed command repeation behavior.

rlhist.c       removed the history command, no longer needed to look up the
               index, just a working short memory.

config.c       added repeat on enter option in config.

parse.c        the command part of a line received by parse input
               has vars and functions substituted right away.

               If passing a command to another session the functions and
               variables are substituted as well, setting the values of
               the controlling session.

math.c         Added the tintoi and tincmp functions, which are enhanced
               versions of atoi and strcmp.

net.c          Added some code to stop enters being written to the scrollback
               buffer, useful for people using #cr to bust a prompt.

rl.c           Got rid of the prompt saving stuff, now using brute force,
               refresh the prompt everytime the screen is updated. This to
               work around a bug in readline that gives odd behavior with
               cursor movement.


March 2004     1.89.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

math.c         Added a close to complete mathematical expression routine.
               Needs some work still but it works. Also allows for comparing
               strings <= >= == != if you enclose the strings in " ". It's
               quite a bit better than the old one, though it's not supporting
               T, F, and '!' since it's string based, shouldn't be too hard
               adding some better string support.

ivars.c        stripped all the stuff that is now covered by math.c or
               variables.c only leaving #ifexits. And then it occured to me
               that #if {"$variable" != "$*"} {true} {false} would
               very well replace the 'ifexits' check. So ivars.c is no more.

data.c         deletenode_list now properly keeps track of a global update
               node. Can only use one noderoot->update per program state.

session.c      cleanup_session now properly keeps track of a global update
               node. Can only use one gtd->update per program state.

rl.c           fixed up the split screen behavior, should be a stable prompt
               and correct text presentation in split mode now.


February 2004  1.88.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
net.c          added telopt negotiations in net.c for naws, terminal type,
               and mccp (version 2)

tintin.h       added the zlib library and a session buffer for mccp

tintin.h       added a 64KB output buffer, I'll just asume that the mud
               output contains a linefeed before BUFFER_SIZE is reached. This
               should make output processing a bit smoother, and saves me
               from fiddling too much with chopped up data.

rl.c           added the tintin_printf and tintin_printf2 functions which
               format the argument list and pass the data on to tintin_puts
               or tintin_puts2

tintin.h       changed the node list struct to work with a head/tail pointer,
               and turned it into a double linked list, updated all .c files
               affected by this change.

*.c            cleaned up the code, using tabs instead of spaces and aligning
               the brackets.

main.c         switched from rand to rand48, it's seeded once upon startup
               which is sufficient.

main.c         added a global tintin session (gts) the idea is to get rid of
               most global variables.

tintin.h       added a bitvector to the session structure which will contain
               all session flags, various changes throughout the code changing
               global variables into flags.

rl.c           fixed up the cursor positioning for split mode and fixed the
               linewrap routine which was off by 1 character, resulting in
               extra lines on a perfect match.
               added a special flag for mud output for split mode, to avoid
               color loss when restoring the cursor (which also restores the
               cursor color, hence the color loss)

tables.c       new c file, which will contain some tables, the current setup
               is a bit tedious.

tintin.h       moved all header files into tintin.h cause the old setup with
               40 headerfiles was giving me a headache (literally).
               Grouped it into typedefs, globals, constants, macros,
               structures and functions

tintin.h       changed all commands to use the COMMAND typedef, as well as
               all commands now use universal arguments and naming, this to
               make a command table.

*.c            There's always a session now, with a few checks for gts (global
               tintin session) which cannot send or receive data. Passing
               session data along with a couple of functions which should
               make background sessions less spammy.

strhash.c      Added a simple string hash routines which I'll be using for a
               scroll back buffer. It uses a bit of memory, but should save a
               lot more for big scroll back buffers.

main.c         changed tstphandler to call kill with a null pid, otherwise it
               wouldn't work when tintin was started from a script

ivars.c        removed backwards compatibility for fixedmath

buffer.c       scroll back buffer and a grep command added

rl.c           made the init_readline function actually initilize readline,
               added 4 default keybinds for the scrollback buffer.

tintin.h       added a keymap to the tintin_data structure, which will be
               used for keybinding.

text.c         got rid of the linewrapper in rl.c and added a word wrap
               routine instead.

log.c          all vt102 codes cept the linefeed are stripped for logged data,
               the lowlog thingie can still be used.

chat.c         Removed this entirely, it's a mess and there are many stand
               alone p2p chat programs available.

*.c            moved some more global data to the session and data structures

rltick.c       removed entirely

ticks.c        removed entirely

tick.c         wrote a new ticker from scratch, uses alarm(1) to sleep 1
               second, the user can now define a list of tickers, pretty much
               like aliasses, they'll trigger when the timer expires. Added
               the 'tick' and 'untick' command for manipulation.

macro.c        added 'macro' and 'unmacro' commands for keybinding, I couldn't
               figure out how to actually undo the real macro's though
               without using a messy hack, so I just skipped that till later
               for now.

session.c      Got rid of the zombi code, will try to add a better connection
               handler at a later data, but the zombi code is not the answer.

tintin.h       Changed architecture further turning the lists from individual
               lists into an array of lists. Added an array in tables.c for
               additional data.

substitute.c   Changed the default #gag char from '.' to character 255, this
               to prevent weird behavior when a dot is displayed on an empty
               line for any kind of reason.

config.c       Added a configuration menu, defaults are loaded upon startup.

walk.c         Removed, didn't really look into it deeply, but I adjusted
               path.c to allow user progged walking using a ticker.

parse.c        Added 2 action checkers, first one checks priority 0 to 4,
               after that substitutions are checked, priority 5 to 9 is
               checked after substitutions.

parse.c        do_one_line now strips colors per default before passing the
               text on to check_one_action

action.c       rewrote the %0 - %9 check_one_action regexp routine, it's
               a bit cleaner and slightly faster now.

action.c       rewrote substitute_vars, ';' is changed to : per default

variable.c     rewrote subsitute_myvariables, no longer supporting $number
               variables. ';' is stripped per default. This also easily
               allows a change so variables can contain numbers.

variable.c     #format {variable} {format} {arguments}
               This allows string formatting, numbers are not supported.
               Added a format parser for further functionality, for now %l
               will lowercase, %u will upper, and %r will reverse the
               argument given. There's a maximum of 10 arguments.

variable.c     Due to the format command, prepad, postpad, tolower, and
               toupper are no longer required, so I removed the commands.
               I realise this generates a backward compatibility issue, but
               it's easier to find the new commands without 70 old commands
               spamming the help files and command lists.

split.c        moved the split screen stuff from rl.c to this new file, and
               placed the prompt commands/routines there as well.

January 2004   1.87.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               After getting tired of seeing my favorite mud client being
               trashed on TMC or simply not having the required functionality
               that is expected nowadays to be worth mentioning, I figured it
               was time to see what I could do. So I downloaded the latest
               official tintin++ release v1.86b and started an evaluation.

               It didn't take long to find out the main problems. Over
               functionality, inconsistant command syntax, total chaos,
               anarchistic implementation views, all in all enough to end up
               deleting about 33% of the code, and rewriting over 50% of what
               remained. Halfways during that process I ran into Bill on the
               wintin forum and I promptly asked him permission to release an
               official tintin++ derivative. And it was agreed that I could,
               if he liked what I came up with. To make a long story short, I
               finished a beta version several weeks later and got Bill's
               permission to name it tintin++.

               The next step was getting permission for the manual, I googled
               up a notification from the authors which said the manual had
               been GPL'ed, see tintin15.cr, last issue fixed.
